## Motivation

We were motivated to create this app to fill a need for our animal shelter by broadening our reach to potential adopters. 
Animal shelter websites are the perfect example of using a website to solve a real world problem. We have found some of 
these websites could use a more appealing layout, and in that thought we decided to create our website, Sheltr.

## Usage
Navigate to the app's URL, create an account, and browse animals available for adoption.
Browse the different tabs to view the adopt, about, contact and donate page. On the 
adopt page, there is a search bar that will recognize name, gender, animal type, and age.
If a user is signed in they will be able to enter an application upon clicking
"adopt me" on the selected pet. When arriving to the donate page a user will see the option
to donate up to 100$, in increments of 10. A user is also able to view their own profile
under the account dropdown menu, which will display data regarding that accounts information,
donations and any adopted animals/applications.
